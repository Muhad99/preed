        <Text style={styles.content}>
          1. <Text>Parental Negligence: When the primary role of parents in protecting their children through 	teaching and training on sexual vices and the paying of particular attention to their well- being is 	neglected or done with negligence, unpleasant outcomes may occur.</Text>
        </Text>

          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          3. <Text>Single Parenting: The absence of one of the parents sometimes provides more opportunities for 	sexual predators to abuse the children. The involvement of the single parent with his or her 	opposite-sex friends could also expose the child/children to sexual abuse (Ezekiel 16: 44).</Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          4. <Text>Too Much Trust: In several cases, children were sexually abused by those who abused the privilege 	of trust put in them by the parents. Friends, family members/relatives, Church members and 	workmen trusted by parents have been found involved in such cases (Matthew 10: 36).

        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>

          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>

          <Text>Child abuse can be traumatic. So whenever it occurs, the child needs appropriate medical, emotional, and spiritual care. As a church, the children's department must be sensitive to watch out for children who are exposed to such abuses and reach out to them prayerfully for their deliverance and total restoration (Psalm 82: 3). Where necessary, the services of professionals in child health and care agencies must be sought.
