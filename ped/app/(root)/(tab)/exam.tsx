                <Text> INTRODUCTION: The beginning of a new
                    year is a good time to re-evaluate our
                    commitments and pursuit of peace in
                    all ramifications.“Peace” (shalom in Hebrew)
                    means much more than a cessation of
                    war. It includes blessings such as
                    wholeness, health, quietness of the soul,
                    preservation and completeness. Living in
                    peace was of paramount Importance to
                    the Jews and to the early church.
                    Little wonder, Paul prayed that peace
                    be multiplied to the recipients of his
                    13 epistles. Peter and John also prayed
                    the same prayer, as we see in 1 Peter 1:2;2
                    Peter 1:2 and Revelations 1:4. This indicates
                    the believer’s need for all-encompassing peace.
                    Thus, our desire should not only be to have the
                    true peace which God alone offers, we must
                    also seek to understand biblical guides on how
                    to access and enjoy that peace for every disciple
                    of Christ (John 14:27).{"\n"}

                    A.TYPES OF PEACE{"\n"}
                    1. Inner Peace: This is personal peace of the
                    mind expressed by physical and spiritual
                    calmness amidst turmoil or potential
                    stressors. It is not equal to a problem-free
                    life. We all go through challenges in life.{"\n"}

                    2. Marital Peace: This is the peace that one
                    enjoys in marriage with one’s spouse, children
                    and even the extended family. It is fundamental
                    to enjoying other types of peace.{"\n"}

                    3. Mental Peace: This is the peace of our mental
                    health. It is about how we think, feel, and behave.
                    It is necessary for our cognitive and emotional
                    well-being.  Absence of mental health can have
                    a negative effect on our physical health.{"\n"}

                    4. Environmental Peace is for a community to be
                    safe and free from harm. There are countries and states
                    where investors do not go because of insecurity and
                    violence. A peaceful environment contributes in no small
                    measure to the total wellness of its inhabitants.
                    When it is lacking, prospective investors keep their
                    businesses away from the environment.{"\n"}

                    5.⁠ ⁠Body/medical Peace is the state of wellness in
                    our health. John prays this type of peace for Gaius
                    (3 John v.2), wishing that he would prosper in his
                    health. God cares for our health.{"\n"}

                    B. FACTORS THAT MILITATE AGAINST MAN’S PEACE
                    1.⁠ ⁠Sin (Isaiah 48:22): It is surprising that even those who
                    cause crises and bring chaos also want peace! God is
                    however unequivocal about it: there is no peace for the
                    wicked. Sin is the root cause of chaos and turmoil.{"\n"}

                    2.⁠ ⁠Hatred and bitterness in human relationships
                    (Ephesians 4:31, 32): Christians who allow bitterness,
                    rage, anger and harsh words in their relationship with
                    others grieve the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 4: 30).Besides,
                    they also open up their lives for crises.{"\n"}

                    3.⁠ ⁠Satan and his cohorts (1 Peter 5:8): The devil, believers’
                    arch enemy, comes to steal, kill and destroy anything that
                    contributes to our abundant living. He tries to destroy our
                    inner, mental, marital, environmental and medical peace.
                    We are to be at alert!{"\n"}

                    4.⁠ ⁠Ignorance (Hosea 4:6): The place of knowledge in enjoying
                    total wellness cannot be over-emphasized. Our lack of the
                    knowledge of God, of ourselves, our environment, our marriage,
                    etc., or our wrong application of such knowledge, also affects
                    our peace. For us to enjoy peace, it is necessary for us to know
                    and rightly apply our knowledge in these areas.{"\n"}

                    5.⁠ ⁠Ungodly government policies (Exodus 1:8 - 16): Though we have
                    limited influence on ungodly government policies, they affect us.
                    The Israelites suffered hardship under Pharaoh who decreed that
                    their newly-born male children be killed. Prayer is one of the
                    greatest weapons of believers in {"\n"}

                    C. STEPS THAT GUARANTEE ALL-ENCOMPASSING PEACE:
                    People search for peace when in financial, religious, communal
                    or political conflict. However, there are steps we can take to
                    give us the kind of confidence expressed by a song-writer
                    who declares. "in the hollow of His (God's) hand!
                    I am safe whatever may betide me." he steps include:{"\n"}

                    1. Be born again (John 3:3; 2 Corinthians 5:21): A child of
                    God enjoys the peace that comes from being forgiven his
                    sins and being made right with God. As he faces daily
                    problems and temptations of life, he Continues to overcome
                    through the power available in Christ (Romans 5:1).{"\n"}

                    2. Turn away from sinful habits (Acts 3:19): Since there can be
                    no righteousness apart from salvation through Christ (Romans
                    3:21-31), there can be no true peace apart from righteousness
                    (Isaiah 32:17). Turning towards righteousness makes believers
                    enjoy peace.{"\n"}

                    3. Know God and His promises in His word (lIsaiah 26:3):
                    When we grow in the love and knowledge of God, we are
                    empowered to set our minds on Him even in turmoil. Isaiah
                    emphasized that perfect peace comes to those whose thoughts
                    are fixed on God.{"\n"}

                    4. Develop faith in Biblical promises (Psalm 125:1 -2; 2 Peter 3:18):
                    God’s promises are “Yes and Amen” and His words donot fail. So,
                    the secret to a believer’s stability is to trust God’s words.
                    This means that we must study, memorize, obey attached
                    conditions and declare His promises to your situation.{"\n"}

                    5. Pray consistently (Philippians 4:5 -7): Believers are not
                    immune to conditions that can make them worry about their jobs,
                    their homes, their schools, etc. However, we are commanded to
                    turn our worries to praver. And when we yield to this command,
                    we will be opening our hearts to the peace of God which surpasses
                    all understanding.{"\n"}

                    6. Pursue peace with all people (Hebrew 12:14, 15): A right
                    relationship with God leads to right relationship with fellow
                    believers. Although we may not always feel love towards all other
                    believers, we must pursue peace as we become more Christ-like
                    (Romans 12:18).{"\n"}

                    CONCLUSION: As the Lord leads us through the year, let us talk
                    deliberate steps to avoid whatever can hinderour peaceful relationship
                    with God and man. And let us not hesitate to pray for the peace of
                    Nigeria as we are in a critical season of insecurity threatening our
                    peaceful existence as a nation (Psalm 122:6).
