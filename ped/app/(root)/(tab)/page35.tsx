          <Text style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>INTRODUCTION:</Text>: Worship is deep reverence for God, awe about God and the rendering of faithful service to God. Worship should not be limited to a particular time. Worship is the response of a person to the revelation of God at any particular time. The fact is that it is difficult to offer worship to God without a personal encounter and knowledge of God. God is not worshipped anyhow and in ignorance.

        <Text style={styles.subtitle}>GUIDELINES FOR TRUE WORSHIP</Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          1.<Text>Total involvement of spirit, soul and body. Our spirit is the human personality which makes relationship with God possible (John 4: 24; Romans 8: 16). Soul is man's state of consciousness, the seat of appetite, emotion and will (New Concise Bible Dictionary, page 527). The Body is the physical structure of man. Therefore since man is made of these three elements, all of them are necessary for the worship of God.
          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          2. <Text>Walk in unity with others (Amos 3: 3; Psalm 133: 1- 3). The purpose of creation is to glorify God 	through worship. God is glorified when our minds are not divided against one another in bitterness 	and rancour. It is important to state here that the life of the worshipper matters more to God than 	the acts of worship we render.</Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          3. <Text>Orderliness in the house of God. God does not live in a confused  or chaotic environment. 	Therefore worship must be well planned and conducted in an orderly manner.</Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          4. <Text>Believers' edification (1 Corinthians 14: 16; Romans 12: 1, 2). True worship is characterized by the 	ability to give spiritual strength to other believers. This is done through holy living and proper use 	of spiritual gifts.</Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          5.  <Text>Biblical prayer. Prayer is an act of worship. Worship that will be acceptable must involve prayers 	which are offered in line with biblical injunctions.</Text>
        </Text>

        <Text style={styles.subtitle}>HOW TO AVOID DISTRACTIONS DURING CHURCH WORSHIP</Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          1.<Text>Always be conscious of His divine presence (Habakkuk 2: 20). The consciousness of the divine 	presence of God brings awe, reverence and the holy fear of God into our hearts. This helps us to 	remain focused on the person of God. </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          2.<Text>Be spiritually and physically prepared to experience God in worship. Worship requires adequate 	preparations (Exodus 19:10; 22,23). Spiritual and physical preparations are signs that show 	expectation for God's presence and His manifold blessings.

          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          3.<Text>Avoid the use of handsets during worship. As much as possible avoid the use of handset in worship 	particularly for things which are not related to worship. There is a high temptation to want to use 	the handset for other purposes if it is with you during worship.

          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          4.<Text>Avoid unnecessary side talk. Unnecessary side talk during worship is a sign of disrespect for God. 	Worship requires total consecration and attention on God.
          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          5.<Text>Avoid frequent going in and out of the auditorium or movements within the auditorium. When a 	worshipper does not settle down during worship he/she causes distraction to other worshippers, 	disrupts the worship process and also misses out some of the vital elements and moments of 	worship. In particular, Church Workers must minimize walking up and down the auditorium during 	worship service.

          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          6.<Text>Avoid sale of materials during worship. The heart of worship is showing reverence to God. 	However, where the worship center  turns toa market place, it will turn away the presence of the 	Holy Spirit.

          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          7.<Text>Avoid bringing dirty and mutilated notes for offering (Malachi 1:6-8). God deserves the best from 	the worshippers. Dirty and mutilated notes do not glorify God.
          </Text>
        </Text>


        <Text style={styles.subtitle}>REWARDS OF TRUE WORSHIP</Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          1.<Text> Liberty from sin and all forms of satanic yokes (Psalm 16: 11). True worship breaks the bondage of 	sin and every power of Satan. In the atmosphere of worship, chains are broken because the 	presence of God is present.
          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          2.<Text> Victory over the enemy (Luke 1: 68 -71). True worship weakens the power of the enemy because it 	brings down the presence and power of God and wherever God reigns, the power of the enemy 	cannot thrive.
          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          3.<Text> Divine peace. A true worshipper gets peace after a meaningful session of worship. It 	is the type 	of peace which only God can give.
          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          4.<Text> Divine prosperity. True worship attracts divine prosperity (1Kings 3:3-5).
          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          5.<Text> Divine protection (Isaiah 4:5- 6). God's presence that comes down serves as a covering for the true 	worshipper (a wall of fire and cloud of smoke). He shields the worshipper from every form of evil.
          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          6.<Text> Fullness of Joy (Psalm 118: 24). True worship gladdens the heart of the worshipper. There is 	indescribable joy in the atmosphere of His presence that worship brings us into.
          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.subtitle}>CONCLUSION</Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          <Text>:For us to have the full benefit of true worship there must be orderliness, planning and deep reverence for God. The commitment expected of true worshippers involves being conscious of God's
            presence anytime and anywhere. Therefore, let us avoid distractions during worship in order to be a partaker of the blessings of worship experience.
