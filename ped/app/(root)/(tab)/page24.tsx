          <Text style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>INTRODUCTION:</Text>Conflict is inevitable in any human relationship. Who two people come together in marriage, there is bound to be misunderstanding, disagreements and contlicts due to differences in understanding, opinions and practices. God uses marriage as a training school to teach us about love. Conflicts are the tests in the school of marriage. You cannot avoid conflicts in your marriage but you can decide to make them strengthen your marriage.

        <Text style={styles.subtitle}>A. SOME COMMON CAUSES OF CONFLICTS</Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          1. <Text>Temperamental difference. A person's temperament is his/her personality traits that determine how 	he/she reacts to the world. When there is lack of understanding of one's partner's temperament 	there may be constant conflicts. </Text>
        </Text>

        <Text style={styles.content}>
          2. <Text>Infidelity. One of the three main reasons for a Christian marriage is to avoid sexual immorality (1 	Corinthians 7: 1 - 7). Marital unfaithfulness has been a major cause of crises in marriage
            (Matthew 5:32 19:9 cf Deuteronomy 24: 1 - 4). When a partner commits sexual sin, the other 	partner feels cheated, embittered, and betrayed.

          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          3. <Text>Tight Finances (Ecclesiastes 10: 19; 1 Timothy 5: 8). Lack of enough money has often led to 	conflicts between couples because of the inability to meet these needs. This lack may be as a result 	of the following: laziness (Proverbs 13: 4, 19: 15), extravagant spending (Luke 15:11-14, Proverbs 	21: 20), joblessness (1 Timothy 5: 8), bad economy  (2 Kings 6: 24-25), Satanic attacks (Job 1: 13-	21) etc.</Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          4. <Text>Barrenness. Barrenness may mean that child-bearing is delayed or totally not achieved in a family. 	This can become very unbearable for the partners especially the woman who, in many instances, is 	constantly exposed to various assaults from the husband and other family members (1 Sarnuel 1:6-	7, Genesis 21: 8 - 10). Sometimes, in a bid to get a solution, coupies are lured into taking steps that 	lead to unwholesome practices that may lead to further crisis (Genesis 16:1-2).


          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          5. <Text>Conflict reveals blind spots in our lives that needs attention or correction. It can as well provide 	opportunities to talk about issues anc increase our understanding of each other (1 Corinthians 13: 	Colossians 3: 13; Philippians 2: 3; James 1: 2 - 4). Conflicts therefore car either lead to 	misunderstanding, distance and silence or greate understanding, closeness and better 	communication. This is depender on either of the following paths of conflict resolution you take:
            Overbearing in-laws. Being overbearing mearns to be domineering. This is experienced when the 	relationship with i laws affects the couple's relationship negatively, when in-laws become a major 	factor in the family decision-making or demand higher authority over a spouse's position in the 	family; when the in-laws demand higher attention, concern and care than is warranted in the 	family. This reflects lack of proper cleaving amongmarried coupies (Genesis 2:24)

        <Text style={styles.subtitle}>B. PATHSTHROUGH CONFLICT IN MARRIAGE</Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>

          <Text>Satan's path for conflict in marriage (John 8: 44, 10: 10a), God's path for conflict in marriage (John 	10: 10b). For Christian couples, there should not be any other way arour conflict in marriage than 	to tow the path of Christ as we find the word of God. Satan's path leads to destruction !</Text>
        </Text>


        <Text style={styles.subtitle}>C.STEPS TO RESOLVING CONFLICT IN MARRIAGE</Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          <Text>As couples you will face conflicts. Finding a God honouring solution through the following steps 	and deliberately inviting God into your situations will help you resolve conflicts and strengthen 	your marriage.</Text>
        </Text>

        <Text style={styles.content}>
          1. <Text>Control your anger (Ephesians 4: 26-27 cf. Genesis 4: 3 - 8). The anger of man never works out the 	righteousness of God (James 1: 20). arn to resolve conflicts before involving others (Matthew 	18:15-17).
          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          2. <Text>Learn to follow biblical guides to conflict resolution.</Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          3. <Text>Make time to talk. Choose the right time, pray, listen and talk (Matthew 7: 3-5):


          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          4. <Text>If necessary, seek counsel. Godly counsels from experienced 7elders help shed light on issues that 	may be difficult for a couple to resolve (Proverbs 20: 18).


          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          5. <Text>Track the root of the problem and find a permanent solution to it prayerfully. It is for lack of 	knowledge and understanding that God's people are destroyed (Hosea 4: 6).</Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          6. <Text>Focus on changing your faulty behavior. Neither the husband nor the wife is perfect. One godly 	way of preventing conflicts is for each partner to prayerfully work on individual weaknesses or 	faults.</Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          7. <Text>Forgive each other (Colossians 3: 13). To err is human; to forgive is divine. Since the home is a 	Christian home, forgiveness should be practised in the home.</Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          8. <Text>Hug each other. Words should be followed by actions.  A hug is but the acceptance and beginning 	of reconciliatory efforts.  Once forgiveness has been sought, no barriers, distance or 	separationshould be allowed</Text>
        </Text>



        <Text style={styles.subtitle}>CONCLUSION</Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          <Text>: In conclusion there are three things you should not use as weapons when you are angry. These are:

          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          1. <Text>Never say "I don't love you'", "I hate you", "I wish I had never married you'", or "I never really 	loved you". Those words are hard to forget and you can't take them back.</Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          2. <Text>Never hit. Avoid physical assault; hands are intended to protect cares and reassure.  </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          3. <Text>Avoid verbal 	assault. Don't say "foolish woman", "worthless man", "lazy" or "liar".</Text>
        </Text>
