          <Text style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>INTRODUCTION:</Text> : In the gospel of (Matthew 6:2a, 5a and 16a), the Lord Jesus taught His disciples three specific spiritual activities and the necessary guidelines on how to do them to glorify God in heaven, Of these three, no believer finds it difficult accepting that God expects us to pray or to give to the needy. When it comes to fasting however. questions begin to arise. Inferring from the teachings of the Lord Jesus, these three are spiritual exercises to be practiced. Proper attention is therefore to be paid to fasting, prayer and giving by every believer.

        <Text style={styles.subtitle}>A. WHAT TO DO DURING A FASTING.</Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          <Text>Fasting and Prayer are correlates. One can pray without fasting, but cannot fast without praying. For fasting to maximize its full potential and yield divine outcomes of God's interventions, miracles and other supernatural manifestation, the following points must be laid to heart.</Text>
        </Text>

        <Text style={styles.content}>
          1. <Text>Meditating on the Word of God. Set a time for this (Psalms 1:1,2).
          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          2. <Text>The period should also be characterized with personal heart searching and earnest continuous 	prayer.</Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          3. <Text>The believer must create enough time for solitude during prayers. If there will not be a time to 	meditate on God's Holy Word and prayers, then a fast is not needed.

        <Text style={styles.subtitle}>B. STEPS TO EFFECTIVE FASTING AND PRAYER</Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>

          <Text>According to Bill Bright in his write-up Basic Steps to Effective Fasting and Prayer 	(https:cloversites. com), the Holy Spirit normally calls sensitive believers to the realm of waiting in 	God's presence. When He does, the following basic steps to fasting should guide the preparation 	and make the time of waiting on the Lord more spiritually and physically rewarding.</Text>
        </Text>

        <Text style={styles.content}>
          1. <Text>Set your Goal: What is the objective of your fasting? Plan and also consult the Holy Spirit to 	clarify His leading and objectives for your prayer and fasting..

          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          2. <Text>Make your Plan: To observe a successful fasting programme you need to have a plan. The plan 	should cover how long will the fast be, how much time each day will be devoted to prayer and 	God's Word etc. "These plan and commitments ahead of tirme will help you have a result oriented 	fast," (Dr. Bill Bright: Your Personal Guide to Fasting and Prayer www.thegrovesantaje.com).

        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          3. <Text>Prepare Yourself Spirituaily: The very foundation of fasting and prayer is confession of sin. Un-	confessed sin will hinder your prayers. Here are few things you can do to prepare your mind
            spiritualy:



          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          a. <Text>Ask God to help you make a comprehensive list of your sins. Confess every sin that the Holy Spirit 	calls to your remembrance and accept God's forgiveness (1 John 1:9).


          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          b. <Text>Seek forgiveness from all you have offended, and forgive all who have hurt you (Mark 11:25).


          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          c. <Text>Make restitution as the Holy Spirit leads you.


          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          d. <Text>Ask God to fill you with the Holy Spirit according to his command in (Ephesians 5: 18; 1John 5: 	14-15).


          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          e. <Text>Begin your time of fasting and prayer with an expectant heart (Hebrews 11: 6).


          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          f. <Text>Do not underestimate spiritual opposition because Satan sometimes intensifies the natural battie 	between the body and the spirit (Galatians 5: 16, 17)




          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          4. <Text>Prepare Yourself Physically: There are physical preparations necessary to organize an effective fast. "Fasting requires reasonable precautions. Consult your physician first, especially if you are on prescription medication or have a chronic ailment. Some persons should never fast without professional supervision." (Dr. Bill Bright: Your Personal Guide to Fasting and Prayer www.thegrovesantafe.com). You need both and spiritual body to have an effective fast. So, get your body prepared. Here are some helpful suggestions to consider as suggested by Bill Bright:


          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          a. <Text>Avoid drugs, even natural/herbal homeopathic remedies. However, medicat√≠ons should only be 	with drawn under your physician's s supervision.




          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          b. <Text>Limit your activity.


          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          c. <Text>Take your bath and brush your teeth.


          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          d. <Text>Exercise moderately.


          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          e. <Text>Rest as much as your schedule will permit.


          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          f. <Text>Expect some physical I discomfort, on the first an second day suc as slight headache. This will go 	naturally.


          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          5. <Text>Plan a Schedule: To have a result-oriented fast, you must create time to wait on the Lord in 	solitude, for meditation and prayer. It is therefore mandatory to set aside ample time to be alone 	with the Lord. The more time you spend with Him, the more meaningful your fast will be.


          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          6. <Text>Break your Fast Gradually: When the set time to end your fast comes, begin to eat again but how 	you break your fast is extremely important for your physical and spiritual well-being. Start feeding 	your stomach gradually. Do not eat solid foods immediately after a fast. Suddenly reintroducing 	solid foods to
            your stomach and digestive tract will likely have negative, even damaging consequences. Start 	from liquid to semi liquid to light solid and then to solid food. If you end your fast with the correct
            diet gradually, the beneficial physical and spiritual effects will result in continued good health.



          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.subtitle}>CONCLUSION</Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>

You will see answers to your prayers." (Bill Bright). May the Holy Spirit refresh your soul as you fast unto the Lord in Jesus' name. Wait for the manifestation by faith.
