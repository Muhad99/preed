          <Text style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>INTRODUCTION:</Text>One of the greatest challenges a married couple can face is childlessness. This can be a temporary or permanent situation. Apart from other causes, barrenness or delay in having children can be
          from God as a test of our faith (1 Samuel 1: 5b). Therefore to know how to reach out to such couples is of great importance and should be prayerfully engaged in by all because it will go a long way in alleviating the trauma they pass through.

        <Text style={styles.subtitle}>WAYS TO MINISTER TO CHILDLESS COUPLES</Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          1. <Text>Pray for and with them (Galatians 6: 2). Going through the routeof infertility is not easy as it is 	emotionally, socially and financially demanding. They therefore need our prayers both privately 	and sometimes with them for divine help to be able to maintain their  spiritual stamina and faith 	while waiting for God's time.</Text>
        </Text>

        <Text style={styles.content}>
          2. <Text>Pastors should reach out to individual couples, Reve. generally praying for such couples, the pastor 	should get to know such couples so he can be acquainted with the needs of each waiting couple. 	This will help in knowing how best to minister each couple.</Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          3. <Text>Avoid much of publicly identifying with their need during to services/meetings that are not 	specifically planned for suck torturing their emotions. purposes. Instead of encouraging them, such, 	most times end up</Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          4. <Text>Family members should support them financially. The notion that they always have excess money 	because they don't have children should be avoided. The cost of fertility treatments and drugs are 	very expensive. As such, they should be supported financially where possible.
          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          5. <Text>Be sensitive in your choice of words and avoid unnecessary jokes. Our words are powerful. They 	could either encourage or discourage the waiting couple, especially the women who carry more of 	the emotional burden and societal stigma of barrenness.


          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          6. <Text>Avoid taunting them with your children (1 Samuel 1: 6, 7). It is an ungodly act to use their 	situation to taunt them knowing fully well that God is the one who gives children.

        <Text style={styles.subtitle}>C.COUNSEL TO CHILDLESS COUPLES</Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          1. <Text>Know that God makes things beautiful in His own time (Ecclesiastes 3:11, Romans 8:28). 	Abraham and Sarah were well advanced in age (100 and 90 years respectively) and have been 	married for years before they had Isaac because God did not forget them(Genesis 21:1-2) He is 	able to do that for any childless couple who keeps trusting Him.</Text>
        </Text>

        <Text style={styles.content}>
          2. <Text>Be intentional in your relationship with God whether the child comes or not (Romans 8:35-39). 	Abraham kept trust in God even when it appeared that the situation was hopeless. Zechariah and 	Elizabeth kept serving God faithfully (Luke 1:6-9). Don't allow  your situation hinder you from 	serving the Lord.
          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          3. <Text>Resolve to continue your commitment to love and care for one another. This we see in the case of 	Elkanah and Hannah (1 Samuel 1:5-8; Colossians 3:18- 19).

          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          4. <Text>Seek counsel from a trusted spiritual father/mother or mentor (Proverbs 19: 20, 21). Whenever it 	seems that you are down emotionally, seek for spiritual help.


          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          5. <Text>Avoid ungodly alternatives (Psalm 1: 1, 2). Waiting for God's time is always the best as cutting 	corners can result in unpalatable consequences (Genesis 16: 2-6).



          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          6. <Text>Pray continually with your spouse. This will unite you and gladden the heart of God (1 Samuel 1:5, 	7; John 16: 24)



          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          7. <Text>Have a trusted prayer partner. This should be someone you can share and pray with (Matthew 18: 	18-20).



          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          8. <Text>Seek the help of medical practitioners who must be prayerfully selected. Medical discoveries and 	understanding now make it possible to assist conception and child delivery. Where affordable, 	childless couples should take advantage of such under professional guidance.



          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          9. <Text>Spend more time together. It is important that couples spend more time together and communicate 	freely with one another.



          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          10. <Text>Hold on to God's word. Even when circumstances say otherwise, hold on to God's word like 	Abraham and Sarah did. For God is faithful to all His promises and nothing is hard for Him to do 	(Proverbs 3:5; Romans 4:3).



          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          11. <Text>Walk with God because He never forgets His own. Children are His heritage and He alone gives 	them to couples (Psalms 127:3-5).



          </Text>
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          12. <Text>Consider adopting a child or two. This should be done following proper legal procedures and 	documentation. The couple should take good care of the child like their own blood.



          </Text>
        </Text>


        <Text style={styles.subtitle}>CONCLUSION</Text>
        <Text style={styles.content}>
          <Text>: Children are the heritage of the Lord and He gives to whomsoever He wants at the appointed time and in the right number. Any couple having delay in having their own children should continue to trust God, love each other, seek godly help and counsel where possible, and never lose hope because our God is able. All those who walk with God have great stories to tell. May the good Lord strengthen and uphold such couples in Jesus' name. Amen.
