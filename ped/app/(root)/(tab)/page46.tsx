          <Text style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>INTRODUCTION:</Text>Money is an important commodity required by everyone to meet basic physical needs and obligations. There is nothing bad in having money as long as it is gotten legitimately. The problem lies in the love of it beyond godly considerations. This love, in today's world is such that many do not care about its source and how it is gotten. Sadly, it has become a controller of people instead of people controlling it; hence many vices and problems have arisen from this inordinate love for money. The Bible warns that those who hasten or labour to get rich by all means often come to ruin or poverty (Proverbs 23: 4, 28: 20, 22).
