        <Text style={styles.content}>
          2. <Text>IPaul the Apostle affirmed this promise through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit (Phiipians 3: 20). 	As one of the enviable Apostles highly regarded by Christians, Paul also emphasized the kingdom 	of God as the main deal for believers, having in mind that the stay here on earth is only temporary.</Text>
        </Text>
